## Overview

Fine-tuning large language models on domain-specific datasets can significantly enhance their performance on related tasks. This repository demonstrates how to fine-tune the Mistral-7B-v0.1 model using the `gbharti/finance-alpaca` dataset.

## Requirements

To run the fine-tuning process, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- PyTorch
- Transformers (Hugging Face)
- Datasets (Hugging Face)
- CUDA (for GPU support)

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the required packages

## Usage
Open the Jupyter notebook and follow the steps to fine-tune the Mistral model:
1. Start Jupyter Notebook
2. Open `mistral7b_finance_dataset.ipynb` in your browser.
3. Follow the instructions within the notebook to load the dataset, configure 
   the model, and initiate the fine-tuning process.

## Dataset
The dataset used for fine-tuning is `gbharti/finance-alpaca`, a financial dataset that facilitates enhanced performance on finance-related tasks. More details about the dataset can be found here.

## Model
The model used in this project is `Mistral-7B-v0.1`, a powerful language model designed for various NLP tasks. More information about the Mistral model can be found on the official page.

## Results
After fine-tuning, the performance of the Mistral-7B-v0.1 model can be evaluated on different financial benchmarks to assess improvements. Detailed results and evaluation metrics will be included in future updates to this repository.
